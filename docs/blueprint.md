## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to convey a sense of calm and trustworthiness, which are appropriate to medical contexts.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, to maintain a clean, professional appearance. This fits a light scheme.
- Accent color: Slightly darker blue (#77B5FE), creating visual interest in active components like buttons, without detracting from the light/airy aesthetic.
- Secondary colors: Gray (#A9A9A9) and Black (#000000) for text and borders to provide contrast and structure.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for a modern feel.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) which pairs with Belleza for longer blocks of text to improve readability and maintain style.
- Use professional, clear icons to represent different functions, like patient registration and test requests.
- Implement a fully responsive layout, using a grid system for easy organization of elements across different screen sizes.
